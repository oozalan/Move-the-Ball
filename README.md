# Move-the-Ball
We've made this game for the CSE1142 Computer Engineering II course with a group of two.
## How to Run
To be able to run the game, Java needs to be installed on your computer.   
Download all the files and execute the LaunchGame.java file, and then you can start playing it.

## How to Play
It is very simple. Move the pieces of the game board by dragging them to make a path for the ball. The path should connect the starting point of the ball and the exit.      

There are five levels in the game, and you can complete them all in the same manner. Enjoy!
